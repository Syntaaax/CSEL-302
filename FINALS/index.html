                    <h4>Can deaf people communicate without sign language?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Common visual communication modes include American Sign Language (ASL), cued speech, lip speech reading and gestures.

                    <h4>Can deaf people use sign language?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Sign language allows people who are deaf or hard of hearing to enjoy rights just like anyone else, they are able to learn, work, and socialize. Sign language uses hand positions and movement to communicate and has existed for centuries.

                    <h4>Why do deaf people prefer sign language?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Sign languages are an extremely important communication tool for many deaf and hard-of-hearing people. Sign languages are the native languages of the Deaf community and provide full access to communication.

                    <h4>Is there a Filipino sign language?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Filipino Sign Language (FSL) or Philippine Sign Language (Filipino: Wikang pasenyas ng mga Pilipino), is a sign language originating in the Philippines. Like other sign languages, FSL is a unique language with its own grammar, syntax and morphology; it is neither based on nor resembles Filipino or English.

                    <h4>What is the history of sign language in the Philippines?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Filipino Sign Language is a signed language that is mostly based on American Sign Language, which was introduced into the country after the Spanish-American War ended in 1899. The first school was started for the Deaf and Blind about 1907 by Miss Delight Rice.

                    <h4>How do deaf people communicate if they don t know sign language?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Deaf children naturally pick up lip-reading. Those who develop deafness later in life are more likely to rely on lip-reading, rather than sign language, as they are more used to and aware of seeing oral speech patterns.

                    <h4>What are the barriers faced by the deaf community?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Deaf children are often delayed in acquiring and developing their language because they don't get early access to sign language. Children who live in poverty or in rural areas can't afford or get access to technology such as hearing aids.

                    <h4>What are two issues that may be of concern to individuals within the deaf culture?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Studies reveal that deaf people are around twice as likely to suffer from psychological problems such as depression and anxiety. Research suggests this stems from feelings of isolation. Making matters worse, the most effective treatment for these types of issues is usually talking with a therapist.

                    <h4>What challenges do deaf people have when working?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Once hired, deaf workers may become discouraged because the people around them do not know how best to communicate with them. They may feel isolated and keep to themselves while at work. Many coworkers have never worked with a deaf person before, so they may feel awkward and unsure about how to approach deaf people

                    <h4>How is the deaf community discriminated against?</h4>
                    <p>
                        People who are deaf or hard of hearing are often excluded from their communities, denied equal access to basic services and face stigma and violence. Students who are deaf are uprooted from families and communities because their school doesn't offer instruction in sign language.
